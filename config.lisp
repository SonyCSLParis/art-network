                                       "Because this is a marriage picture, it is inspired by ancient marriage poems."
                                       "It is possible that Venusâ€™s features may be taken from the bride's."
                                       "The beautifully observed details relate to the goddess and marriage."
                                       "The ivy is symbolic of fidelity; brides wore a myrtle wreath; incense perfumes the bower; a snake warns against jealousy.")))
